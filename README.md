Implement the push and pall opcodes.



The push opcode



The opcode push pushes an element to the stack.



Usage: push <int>

where <int> is an integer

if <int> is not an integer or if there is no argument given to push, print the error message L<line_number>: usage: push integer, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

where is the line number in the file

You wonâ€™t have to deal with overflows. Use the atoi function

The pall opcode



The opcode pall prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.



Usage pall

Format: see example
Implement the pint opcode.



The pint opcode



The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.



Usage: pint

If the stack is empty, print the error message L<line_number>: can't pint, stack empty, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
Implement the pop opcode.



The pop opcode



The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.



Usage: pop

If the stack is empty, print the error message L<line_number>: can't pop an empty stack, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
Implement the swap opcode.



The swap opcode



The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.



Usage: swap

If the stack contains less than two elements, print the error message L<line_number>: can't swap, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
